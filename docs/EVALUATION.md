# swapService — Current Engineering Evaluation and Remediation Plan

## Current exact-source assessment — 2026-10-07

**Release and real funds remain blocked.** This assessment covers detached exact source
`2c4ed319d251836f01dfb83de68da71b1c6c6a23`, matching `origin/main`, against previous remote
source `a28c958800f64e802b3dfc367ac49ecf7a18e5fb`. The source-assessment phase made documentation changes only. No live
Solana/Nexus request, credential, transaction, deployment or approval reroute was performed.
Subsequent documentation-only publication is recorded separately and grants no release authority.

The strategic scope is **O4 attributable settlement and bounded risk**, supported by **O3
reproducible provenance** for artifact/recovery evidence and **O1 open coordination** through
inspectable evidence contracts. **O5 validated reliance remains an unpassed external-acceptance
objective.** This repository does not establish O2 namespace authority beyond requiring an exact
service-record identity. The settlement use case remains an explicit non-Atlas hypothesis; it must
not inherit marine Class A evidence. Operator custody remains the transitional SD-002 condition.
No result here proves non-custody, enforceable slashing/collateral, regulatory status, adoption or
closure of SD-003–SD-008.

### Accepted progress since `a28c958`

The sealed-image/witness runtime is now published. Its one-use `ready → claimed → running →
ready(next generation)` protocol, exact SQLite image/schema/configuration checks, recovery-before-
running ordering, runtime lease checks, quiescent seal and read-only snapshot dashboard all pass
the current offline suite. Subsequent increments now bind, inside `build_fingerprint()`, the root
entrypoint, running interpreter bytes, conventional foundational native mappings, the installed
`solders` extension, its root/flat/token/RPC/optional wrapper sources, and the selected
`rpc.requests`, `rpc.responses` and `rpc.errors` wire wrappers. Invalid selected evidence refuses
before witness-permit consumption. These are accepted as **finite in-process drift containment**,
not as complete or trusted pre-execution attestation.

The four retained-source conflict containments remain accepted narrowly offline: ordinary
refund/quarantine states, ready rows with prior debit metadata, ready rows with capacity siblings,
and ready rows with terminal siblings preserve principal/evidence and call no transport. The
empty-database latch, monotonic recovery boundary, exact frozen-policy checks, terminal-provenance
migration, typed capacity holds and read-only dashboard controls also remain required. None proves
a coherent partial restore or historical authorization after lost SQLite evidence.

### Fresh offline verification

The installed reusable environment was Python **3.11.15** with `python-dotenv==1.2.2`,
`solana==0.36.9`, `solders==0.26.0`, `requests==2.33.0` and `pytest==9.1.1`; GitHub CI remains
configured for Python 3.12. Collection found exactly **1,522 tests**. The complete suite passed
**1,522 tests and 77 subtests** in 121.35 seconds. The current remote SHA has successful CI run
[37547865322](https://github.com/distordialabs-brutus/swapService/actions/runs/37547865322);
that remote status is publication evidence, not live or release acceptance.

| Executed boundary | Fresh result |
|---|---|
| `python -m pytest --collect-only -q` | **1,522 collected** |
| `python -m pytest -q` | **1,522 passed, 77 subtests passed** |
| Ten custody admission/artifact/witness/runtime/dashboard modules | **667 passed** |
| Ten recovery/retained-state/capacity modules | **414 passed, 52 subtests passed** |
| Focused negative/concurrency/restart selection | **39 passed** |
| CI isolation shards | **35 passed/52 subtests; 36 passed/52 subtests; 85 passed** |
| dependency consistency, compilation, Markdown links, token-pair inventory and whitespace | Passed; inventory has **274 active lines** |

### Current blocking findings

1. **P0 — artifact authority is still in-process and incomplete.** Repository imports and root code
   execute before `build_fingerprint()` can refuse. The finite manifest deliberately omits other
   transitive Solana/HTTP/stdlib/bytecode/shared-library artifacts and does not attest mapped memory.
   A digest computed by the mutable artifact cannot attest itself. Batch 0 therefore remains open
   until an external trusted launcher or immutable-image authority verifies the complete executable
   closure before repository code, lock creation, database access, witness claim or chain access.
2. **P0 — complete restore authorization remains unproved.** Exact image continuity can preserve an
   incomplete, stale or pre-fix image. Table non-emptiness, local timestamps and source rediscovery
   are not proof that every policy, capacity, submission, fee and terminal component belongs to one
   coherent generation. The next recovery batch must audit every selectable/nonterminal state or
   require independently approved coherent restore/bootstrap identity.
3. **High — service and node readiness remain identity-incomplete.** A fresh offline probe supplied a
   heartbeat object with different address, owner, provider, pair and vault but the three required
   scalar fields; `validate_heartbeat_asset()` returned true. A second probe showed
   `custody_chain.verify()` succeeds after only Solana `getGenesisHash` and Nexus
   `ledger/get/blockhash height=0`; no health, sync or freshness query is required.
4. **High operability — malformed capacity evidence still starves valid work.** The current historical
   actual-worker probe retained 120 units and made zero sends, but two worker runs left the younger
   valid 60-unit refund behind an older malformed hold; its attempt count reached 3. Containment is
   safe, but eligible FIFO progress is not implemented.
5. **High operability — witness and hold operations are incomplete.** The reference witness has no
   collected independent-process contested-claim/crash matrix, supported certificate evidence export,
   audited bootstrap/restore ceremony or evidence-bound resolution protocol for non-capacity Solana
   holds. The existing SQLite/API unit coverage does not establish independent anti-rollback deployment.
6. **External acceptance remains absent.** No approved devnet/testnet node, pagination, finality,
   accepted-but-unparsed, crash/restore, total-loss or operator rehearsal was executed. O5 remains open.

### Grounded next batches

| Batch | Objective / evidence / vision outcome | Production owner and paths | Human authority boundary | Executable exit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 — external executable authority | O4/O3 with supporting O1; non-Atlas hypothesis; prove which bytes executed before value-moving admission | Deployment launcher/image owner plus swapService startup; `swapService.py`, `src/custody_admission.py`, every imported runtime/dependency/interpreter artifact | Independent artifact approver chooses the immutable digest; runtime/operator credentials cannot create or rewrite approval | Mutation of every root/module/dependency/interpreter/launcher byte, including a pre-import side effect, refuses before any repository side effect; exact approved image completes one claim/run/seal generation |
| 1 — closed restore admission | O4/O3; preserve exact authorization and quantified liabilities rather than infer history | swapService recovery owner; `src/state_db.py`, `src/startup_recovery.py`, `src/solana_client.py`, `src/nexus_client.py`, migration/backup format | Named operator approves new bootstrap or coherent restore; missing evidence has no automatic-send authority | Schema-driven all-status audit plus partial/stale/pre-fix/DB+WAL/online-backup/total-loss cases prove zero transport and full liability unless exact original intent is restored once |
| 2 — service/node admission | O4 with O2 identity prerequisite and O3 provenance; bind the exact service and authoritative endpoints | swapService adapters; `src/custody_chain.py`, `src/nexus_client.py`, `src/main.py`; pinned Solana/Nexus semantics | Operator pins address/owner/schema/pair/custody/terms and freshness policy; configuration labels cannot repair observations | Wrong/stale/unsynced/malformed evidence refuses before database mutation or recovery; exact target-node evidence passes on authorized infrastructure |
| 3 — capacity progress and hold disposition | O4; retain liabilities while making eligible obligations progress | swapService state/workers/dashboard; `src/state_db.py`, `src/solana_client.py`, `src/dashboard.py`, operator tooling | Human may disposition only through an evidence-bound audited protocol; no SQL/direct-send bypass | Malformed/conflicting/unknown rows move atomically outside automatic FIFO; younger valid same/cross-kind work sends once across restart and worker limits; blocked principal remains visible and unchanged |
| 4 — operational witness and O5 acceptance | O3/O5; independently reproducible deployment and externally validated reliance | Deployment/operator owner plus exact final swapService artifact and approved Solana/Nexus test infrastructure | Separate bootstrap/restore/release approvals; target activity requires explicit authorization | Independent-process witness contention/crash rehearsal, evidence export, TLS/anti-rollback deployment, both bridge directions and the full pagination/finality/unknown-outcome/restore matrix pass before a separate release decision |

### Executable negative, concurrency and recovery matrix

The named commands are offline until the final explicitly authorized target-infrastructure row.
Add missing cases to default pytest collection; a scratch script alone is not acceptance.

| Boundary | Negative cases | Concurrency cases | Recovery cases | Exit command / expected result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| External artifact admission | root pre-import side effect; omitted transitive wrapper, bytecode, stdlib, HTTP/Solana dependency, interpreter/launcher mutation; missing/raced/FIFO artifact | two independent processes contend for one permit and one custody image; loser performs no side effect | crash before claim, after claim, after complete response loss and during seal response loss | New collected `tests/test_custody_external_launcher.py`; exact image runs once, every mutation refuses before lock/DB/witness/chain |
| Witness lifecycle | malformed/duplicate certificate JSON, stale generation, wrong owner, lost/ambiguous response | real independent processes and distinct witness connections race claim/complete/hold/seal; observe exactly one owner from a third connection | kill owner at every transition; restart remains held unless an exact next-generation permit was durably sealed | Extend `tests/test_custody_witness.py` and `tests/test_custody_runtime.py`; one owner, no automatic revival, bounded completion |
| Restore admission | every nonterminal status with each required field absent, wrong-typed, contradictory or orphaned; pre-fix manufactured terminal | scanner and worker start attempts race the startup audit; no selector observes unaudited rows | empty, unrelated-row partial, source-only, capacity-only, terminal-only, cap-only, online backup, copied DB+WAL and total loss | Parameterized `tests/test_recovery_admission_matrix.py` through real startup/workers; zero transport/full liability unless exact original intent is restored once |
| Capacity FIFO | malformed/source-conflict/terminal-conflict/unknown-submission oldest row ahead of valid refund/quarantine | real refund and quarantine workers race at exact cap across same- and cross-kind queues | restart, cap aging/decrease/increase, more blocked rows than worker limits | Extend `tests/test_solana_capacity_holds.py`; younger eligible intent sends exactly once, blocked row stays non-sendable with unchanged principal |
| Service/node identity | wrong address/owner/schema/pair/vault/terms; Solana unhealthy/stale root; Nexus unsynced/syncing/wrong network or stale tip; query exceptions | identity/freshness changes between read and witness completion | restart against changed endpoint; retained older healthy observation cannot admit | Extend `tests/test_custody_chain.py` plus target fixtures; no DB/scanner/poller call on failure, exact fresh evidence only |
| Dashboard/operations | missing/unreadable DB, witness mismatch, corrupt hold evidence, absent resolution proof | witness changes around one read-only snapshot; operator resolution races worker selection | restart during resolution and after accepted-but-unparsed disposition | Existing dashboard tests plus new collected operator protocol tests; no writes from reads, no stale green state, one attributable disposition or unchanged hold |
| Authorized external acceptance | unsupported transaction version, pagination truncation, wrong finality/transfer, Nexus incomplete references/TLS failure | concurrent arrivals, timeout after remote acceptance, competing restart | process crash at each intent/submission/finalization boundary; coherent restore and total loss | Explicit devnet/testnet command recorded against the exact immutable artifact; no production funds; human release remains separate |

### Maintenance increment — external container pre-execution admission (2026-10-07)

**Implemented narrowly offline; Batch 0 remains blocked.** This increment adds a standalone
Docker admission launcher, not another in-process SDK fingerprint. An independently installed
copy starts only an exact full-ID, never-started container whose image ID and selected execution
configuration match separately supplied approval pins. The selected projection includes command,
environment, host policy, mounts, network endpoints and security labels. The guard requires a
read-only root, nonprivileged/all-capabilities-dropped policy, no user tmpfs or anonymous volumes,
explicit nonrecursive/private custody and read-only secrets binds, and a pristine whole writable
layer on two inspections. It imports no repository runtime, does not pull/resolve tags, create an
approval, override a command, clear holds, retry, delete containers or alter financial authority.

The focused collected module returned **58 passed**. A red regression demonstrated execution
with duplicate inspection keys; strict parsing now refuses. Independent review found omitted
network pinning and recursively writable secrets binds; selected network/security evidence and
nonrecursive/private declaration/readback checks now cover those paths. An actual isolated CLI
subprocess refused before a mutable `sitecustomize.py` could execute. The actual Docker CLI path
also refused with a sanitized message because this host denies Docker socket access. Docker
boundary tests are injected/offline: no image or container was built or started, and reported
layer-mutation cases are not real immutable-image file-mutation acceptance.

The clean Python 3.12 complete suite returned **1,580 passed, 77 subtests passed** in
104.49 seconds, with no skips. CI-isolation shards returned **35 passed/52 subtests**,
**36 passed/52 subtests** and **85 passed**. Compilation, dependency consistency, local
Markdown links, intended-index literal inventory (**274 active lines**) and whitespace
checks passed. Read-only re-review found no remaining blocker in the declared narrow scope.
Runtime/test SHA-256 evidence:

```text
f18a88ced35757c6486a4f0dc1e7e9dd055daa01223f93ca74ce808f42035f70  scripts/custody_external_launcher.py
772c5b57204c738a6bf1e956d3d6de55e023cb411e6b51f22ee012ea77190d20  tests/test_custody_external_launcher.py
```

**Work-item grounding:** O4/O3 and supporting O1; non-Atlas settlement hypothesis and transitional
custody remain unchanged. Component owner is deployment/startup; the scheduled maintainer acts
under the operator's bounded one-issue authorization. Production path is
`scripts/custody_external_launcher.py`, with collected
`tests/test_custody_external_launcher.py`; existing pinned Solana/Nexus dependencies and custody
runtime are untouched. Base is `dd46d6fbacc1621f61c5e90583899081bc3a77dd`, freshly fetched and
fast-forwarded without unrelated work. See the
[exact external-container contract](maintenance/external-container-admission.md).

The installed launcher/interpreter/Docker daemon/image store/host and supplied approval pins
are trusted external prerequisites, **not self-attested by this script**. Exclusive Docker
administration is required across inspect/diff/start; repeated reads are not an atomic CAS.
Bind contents/runtime pseudo-filesystems are not image bytes. Protected installation, complete
image closure, external-image witness binding, real Docker mount/diff semantics, approved
claim/run/seal, contention/crash/restore and live acceptance remain open. Direct Python startup
is unchanged; this tool is not yet the mandatory supported deployment path. Batch 0, production
and real funds remain blocked. Full/static/index and publication results accompany the exact
maintenance commit report.

### Maintenance increment — refuse Docker-managed restart bypass (2026-10-07)

**Implemented narrowly offline; Batch 0 remains blocked.** On clean publication base
`08e2799`, the external launcher still accepted `always`, `unless-stopped` and
`on-failure` restart policies when their configuration digest was independently pinned.
Docker could consequently restart a previously executed container without repeating the
external admission checks. Three collected regressions reproduced that acceptance before
this fix. Both inspections now require explicit `RestartPolicy.Name="no"` and an exact
integer `MaximumRetryCount=0`; absent or malformed evidence refuses before diff/start.
Approval pinning alone cannot exempt an automatic restart policy. The existing valid
candidate still starts exactly once after both inspections and preserves its exit status.

Collected coverage in `tests/test_custody_external_launcher.py` adds unsafe-policy,
missing/malformed/type-boundary and between-inspection restart-policy drift cases. The
focused module returned **75 passed**. The clean Python **3.12** complete suite returned
**1,597 passed, 77 subtests passed** in 108.96 seconds, with no skips. Static/index and
CI-isolation gates, final diff and exact publication evidence accompany the maintenance
commit report. No dependency, financial worker, custody schema or witness behavior changed.

**Work-item grounding:** O4/O3 and supporting O1; explicit non-Atlas settlement hypothesis
and transitional custody are unchanged. Deployment/startup owns the production path
`scripts/custody_external_launcher.py`; the scheduled maintainer acts under the operator's
one-issue repair/publication authorization. Independent artifact approval and human release
remain separate. The contract is documented in the
[external-container admission note](maintenance/external-container-admission.md).

This prevents the declared Docker restart-policy bypass only. Exclusive protected Docker
administration remains mandatory: another administrator or external supervisor can still
change policy or bypass the guard after inspection. Protected installation, complete image
closure, witness-image binding and real Docker claim/run/seal/mutation/crash acceptance
remain open. This host still denies Docker socket access; engine tests are offline/injected,
not an actual restart rehearsal. Production and real funds remain blocked.

### Maintenance increment — sanitize malformed external host-policy evidence

**Implemented narrowly offline; Batch 0 remains blocked.** On clean publication base
`ea5a1af`, the external launcher dereferenced `HostConfig.get()` without checking that
Docker inspection supplied a JSON object. A matching approval digest with null, array,
string, integer or boolean host policy escaped `main()` as an uncaught `AttributeError`,
violating the launcher's controlled, secret-safe refusal boundary. Five collected
regressions reproduced the exception before the fix. Both inspection iterations now
require object-shaped host policy before reading its restart or execution constraints;
invalid shape follows the existing sanitized `LaunchError` path, with exit status 1
and no diff/start action. No approval, image or financial authority is created.

The focused collected launcher module returned **80 passed**, including unchanged
exact-candidate one-start/exit-status coverage. Full-suite, static/index, isolation and
exact publication results accompany the maintenance commit report. Production paths
are `scripts/custody_external_launcher.py` and its focused tests; no dependency,
custody schema, worker or witness behavior changed.

**Work-item grounding:** Batch 0 external executable authority, O4/O3 and supporting
O1; deployment/startup owns the component and the scheduled maintainer acts under the
bounded one-issue authorization. The non-Atlas settlement hypothesis, transitional
custody and independent artifact/release authority remain unchanged. This fixes a
malformed-evidence reporting boundary only, not complete artifact attestation or a
transport bypass. Engine tests remain offline/injected. Protected installation,
complete image closure, external-image witness binding, real Docker mutation and
claim/run/seal/crash acceptance remain open; production and real funds remain blocked.

### Maintenance increment — private PID namespace admission (2026-10-08)

**Implemented narrowly offline; Batch 0 remains blocked.** On clean publication base
`1c16690`, an independently matching configuration pin allowed both host and shared
`container:<id>` PID namespaces through the external launcher. Two collected red
regressions reached the injected start action. Shared process namespaces can expose
other processes' filesystem roots through `/proc/<pid>/root`, outside the approved
image and mount projection; actual access depends on host permissions/security policy.
Both inspections now require explicit `HostConfig.PidMode=""`, Docker's default
private PID namespace. Missing, malformed and unsupported values refuse with a
sanitized exit 1 before diff/start. A matching approval cannot exempt this constraint.

The focused launcher module returned **91 passed**. Coverage includes both shared
namespace modes, missing/type-confused evidence, between-inspection drift, and the
unchanged exact-candidate one-start/exit-status control. The clean Python **3.12.3**
complete suite returned **1,613 passed, 77 subtests passed** in 109.32 seconds, with no
skips. Static/index, CI-isolation and exact publication evidence accompany the
maintenance commit report. No financial worker, schema, witness or dependency changed.

**Work-item grounding:** Batch 0 external executable authority, O4/O3 and supporting
O1; deployment/startup owns `scripts/custody_external_launcher.py` and its collected
`tests/test_custody_external_launcher.py`. The scheduled maintainer acts under the
operator's bounded one-issue authorization. The non-Atlas settlement hypothesis,
transitional custody and independent artifact/release approval remain unchanged.
See the [external-container admission contract](maintenance/external-container-admission.md).

This contains a shared-process filesystem route only, not complete executable closure
or runtime pseudo-filesystem attestation. Docker evidence is offline/injected; no real
shared-namespace access or approved claim/run/seal generation was exercised. Protected
installation/exclusive Docker administration, complete image closure, external-image
witness binding and real mutation/crash/restore acceptance remain open. Production and
real funds remain blocked.

## Historical verdict — 2026-10-02

**Release blocked.** Committed-runtime and separately reviewed candidate identity:

```text
review base:                       ed73c513ee22f9626502273aa0d8e42a4c238b7a
committed runtime / publication base: 7b2d1c4e3c9d3b2f006a083f9372cfadf80830fc
reviewed local documentation HEAD:    ee10b6e20dfe85f15347386adecb9dc99db55bb5
unpublished runtime index tree:       a73785b8653e3ad03c9216072b7366999ba1e854
```

Four published startup containments now hold retained ordinary dispositions, ready rows with prior debit
metadata, ready rows with capacity siblings, and ready rows with terminal siblings. They preserve full
principal and conflicting evidence rather than deriving current terms, repeating a Nexus debit or deleting
a disputed source. The focused changed-area gate passed 324 tests; keep all four controls.

The unpublished, locally staged sealed-custody implementation candidate adds an independent one-use witness, exact whole-SQLite-image and
schema admission, configuration/source fingerprints, pinned chain genesis checks, recovery-before-running,
per-cycle lease verification, quiescent sealing and a read-only snapshot dashboard. The complete offline
suite for that unpublished runtime candidate passed 947 tests plus 77 subtests; those are not the committed
runtime's test counts. This materially closes the previous missing-database dashboard and
non-durable-startup-truth gaps **only for an exact independently approved image**.

A separate documentation-only publication candidate based on committed runtime `7b2d1c4` and containing
none of the staged sealed-custody runtime passed **848 tests plus 77 subtests**. That publication gate
verifies the committed runtime together with these candidate documents; it does not verify the unpublished
sealed-custody implementation.

It is not release-acceptable yet:

1. `build_fingerprint()` omits the executed root `swapService.py`; a scratch mutation that performed a
   pre-admission side effect retained the approved fingerprint. Installed interpreter/package artifacts are
   also not attested by hashing `requirements.txt`.
2. Genesis equality is not node health/sync/freshness. Heartbeat validation accepts a name-resolved object
   with a different address, owner, provider, pair and vault when the three required fields parse.
3. Required witness/genesis configuration and audited initial/restore certificate generation are not
   integrated into the normal setup/configuration path.
4. Malformed capacity evidence can still starve later eligible frozen work; non-capacity Solana holds still
   lack audited resolution; target-chain acceptance remains absent.

See the [October 2 review](DEVELOPMENT_REVIEW_2026-10-02.md),
[sealed-custody architecture note](maintenance/sealed-custody-admission.md), and the
[current repair plan](plans/2026-09-25-recovery-admission-and-capacity-fairness.md).

### Maintenance increment — root-entrypoint fingerprint drift

**Implemented locally, unpublished; Batch 0 remains blocked.** The in-process
`build_fingerprint()` now includes the required root `swapService.py` alongside the
existing runtime sources and declared requirements. A collected regression first
reproduced an unchanged digest after adding a pre-admission side effect; it now
requires a changed digest without executing the inspected entrypoint. Additional
fixtures reject changed, missing and non-file entrypoints before witness-permit
consumption, preserve the custody image/receipt absence, and exercise exact-build
claim, completion and next-generation sealing.

The focused admission module returned **29 passed**; the clean-environment shared-tree
suite returned **952 passed, 77 subtests passed**. Dependency consistency, compilation,
Markdown links, the existing index's literal inventory and whitespace checks passed.
These results cover the local candidate, not a published commit or production artifact.
The fix depends on the pre-existing staged/uncommitted custody implementation, so it
is intentionally not committed or pushed independently of that feature. The pre-existing
index is unchanged. No live chain or real-fund operation was performed.

This fixes only accidental root-entrypoint drift in the in-process certificate. It
cannot prevent an altered wrapper from executing before the checker; the external
trusted launcher/immutable image, interpreter and installed-artifact attestation in
Batch 0 remain required. Previously approved build digests must not be reused or
silently rewritten for the changed manifest.

### Maintenance increment — running-interpreter fingerprint drift (2026-10-03)

**Implemented in the local candidate; Batch 0 and publication remain blocked.** Local
commit `ebedff796bd201d0c0b690074922cfde21a7a883` already contains the root-entrypoint
repair above and the sealed-custody implementation. This increment addresses the next
missing byte identity: `build_fingerprint()` now incorporates a domain-separated SHA-256
of the running Linux interpreter obtained from `/proc/self/exe`, not `PATH`,
`sys.executable`, a version label or an installed-package declaration. Missing, unreadable,
empty, non-regular or changing executable evidence refuses fingerprint construction.
Streaming reads compare descriptor/path identity, byte size and nanosecond modification
and change times before and after hashing; candidate interpreter bytes are never executed.

Collected coverage in `tests/test_custody_interpreter.py` first reproduced unchanged build
identity after interpreter-byte drift. It now covers drift, invalid evidence, in-place
mutation/replacement/truncation during hashing, sanitized read failure, real running-binary
selection despite spoofed labels, unchanged custody bytes/no receipt/no permit consumption
on rejection, and exact-build claim, completion and next-generation sealing.
The focused five-module custody gate returned **67 passed**; the clean Python 3.12 complete
suite returned **967 passed, 77 subtests passed**. All boundaries remain offline.

`origin/main` is `dba5f358bbe82e09acfbcb3582ae1f8d5d2abeda`, based on `7b2d1c4`, and does
not contain `src/custody_admission.py`. The local prerequisite commits `ee10b6e` and
`ebedff7` are absent from that branch. Publishing this increment would therefore also
publish the larger custody feature or require resolving divergent documentation; neither
is authorized as this narrow maintenance issue. No force push or implicit feature
publication is allowed by this increment.

This is **in-process drift containment only**, not interpreter trust or pre-execution
attestation. Shared libraries, standard library/bytecode, installed dependencies and the
external trusted launcher/immutable image remain Batch 0 exits. Protected filesystem
writing is still required; metadata checks are not an immutable-image guarantee. The
new fingerprint intentionally invalidates prior approvals, including unchanged-interpreter
approvals under the previous manifest. Do not silently rewrite or reuse certificates.
Production and real funds remain blocked.

### Maintenance increment — foundational native-runtime drift (2026-10-04)

**Implemented locally; Batch 0 and publication remain blocked.** The first unresolved
priority remains artifact identity. Root-entrypoint and interpreter-byte containments
in local `ebedff7` and `89fddc7` are preserved, not reimplemented. This increment binds
the on-disk files backing conventional executable `libpython`, C/math-library and
Linux-loader mappings in `/proc/self/maps` into a domain-separated build digest.
Paths are checked against the observed device/inode before streaming their bytes;
descriptor/path size, mode and nanosecond timestamps are rechecked, as is the selected
mapping set. Empty, missing, malformed, unreadable, deleted, anonymous or inconsistent
native evidence refuses fingerprint construction with a sanitized error. Reads are
bounded by the observed size; a raced-in FIFO cannot block the file open.

The initial regression reproduced unchanged build identity after native-file drift.
Race regressions then reproduced acceptance of in-place mutation, replacement,
truncation and changed mappings; all now refuse. A fresh service/dashboard subprocess
regression caught a separate-process identity mismatch when every native extension was
included. The final manifest is deliberately limited to foundational runtime libraries:
normal extension import differences, ASLR, mapping order and duplicate segments do not
change it. Conventional glibc/musl and `ld`/`ld64` loader names are collected; unsupported
names are not attested. Rejection preserves the original ready witness permit, custody
bytes and receipt absence. Exact-build fixtures claim, complete, report healthy and seal
a next generation. Independent review found no blocking defect in this narrow scope.

The six-module focused gate returned **108 passed**, including **41 native-artifact
cases**. The clean Python 3.12 complete suite returned **1008 passed, 77 subtests passed**
in 85.40 seconds. Dependency consistency, compilation, local Markdown links, the
intended index's token-literal inventory (**274 active lines**) and candidate whitespace
passed. The three required CI-isolation shards returned **35 passed/52 subtests**,
**36 passed/52 subtests** and **85 passed**. All chain boundaries remain offline;
no live send, production credential or real-fund operation was used.

This is **in-process on-disk drift containment**, not pre-execution or mapped-memory
attestation. Other shared libraries/extensions, standard library/bytecode, installed
packages, alternate filenames and the external trusted launcher/immutable image remain
Batch 0 exits. The manifest change invalidates existing approvals; never silently rewrite
certificates. `origin/main` remains `dba5f358bbe82e09acfbcb3582ae1f8d5d2abeda`, lacking the
local custody prerequisite and diverging from local `main`. A passing narrow local commit
cannot authorize publishing that larger feature or reconciling remote documentation.
No push or remote CI claim is made. Production and real funds remain blocked.

### Maintenance increment — installed solders extension drift (2026-10-04)

**Implemented locally; Batch 0 and publication remain blocked.** The first unresolved
priority is complete executable-artifact identity. Existing root-entrypoint, interpreter
and foundational-library repairs are preserved. This narrow increment adds a
domain-separated fingerprint of the installed `solders.solders` native extension used
for transaction construction. `PathFinder` locates the conventional extension without
executing its package initializer or library. Exact extension-loader/origin agreement,
absolute path and recognized interpreter suffix are required. Nonblocking streaming
reads are bounded by the observed size, with descriptor/path identity, mode, size and
nanosecond timestamp checks plus repeated extension discovery. Missing, empty,
non-regular, unreadable, inconsistent or changing evidence refuses admission with a
sanitized error before witness-permit consumption.

The initial collected regression reproduced unchanged build identity after extension
byte drift; it now requires a changed digest without execution. The **26-case** new
module covers discovery without package side effects, invalid evidence, mutation,
replacement, truncation, growth, discovery changes, stat/open races and FIFO refusal.
Real offline witness fixtures preserve the ready permit, full custody image and receipt
absence on rejection, then admit the original artifact, complete a healthy lease and
seal the next generation. Separate service/dashboard processes retain equal build
identity. The seven-module focused gate returned **134 passed**; the clean Python 3.12
complete suite returned **1034 passed, 77 subtests passed** in 84.97 seconds. Independent
review found no blocking defect in this narrow scope. Final static and isolation gates
are recorded with the maintenance commit report. No live-chain or real-fund operation
was performed.

This is **in-process on-disk extension drift containment**, not trusted pre-execution
attestation, loaded-memory identity or complete installed-package verification. Python
wrappers, bytecode, other SDK/dependency artifacts, standard library and the external
trusted launcher/immutable image remain Batch 0 exits. A changed fingerprint invalidates
prior approvals; never silently rewrite or reuse certificates. Fresh fetch resolves
`origin/main` to `a28c958`, diverging from local `main` and still lacking the custody
prerequisite. Publishing this repair would also publish that larger feature and require
remote-documentation reconciliation, outside this one-issue scope. No force push or
remote CI claim is authorized. Production and real funds remain blocked.

### Maintenance increment — installed solders Python-source drift (2026-10-05)

**Implemented locally; Batch 0 and publication remain blocked.** The first unresolved
priority remains complete executable-artifact identity. Existing root-entrypoint,
interpreter, foundational-library and native solders-extension repairs are preserved.
This increment binds the installed `solders/__init__.py` and the seven wrappers directly
imported by the runtime: `hash.py`, `instruction.py`, `keypair.py`, `message.py`,
`pubkey.py`, `signature.py` and `transaction.py`. A domain-separated source manifest uses
`PathFinder` without executing inspected packages/modules, requires conventional absolute
source paths and exact `SourceFileLoader`/origin agreement, streams bounded nonblocking
reads, and rechecks descriptor/path metadata, the complete discovery result and earlier
files before accepting the digest. Missing, empty, non-regular, unreadable, bytecode-only,
conflicting or changing selected evidence refuses admission before permit consumption.

All eight initial drift regressions reproduced unchanged build identity before the fix.
The new module also covers discovery without execution, invalid files/loaders/paths,
stat/open races, mutation/replacement/truncation/growth, changes to previously read files,
and changed discovery. Offline witness fixtures preserve the ready permit, full custody
image and receipt absence on rejection, then admit the exact approved build, complete a
healthy lease and seal the next generation. Existing fresh service/dashboard subprocess
identity coverage remains green. The focused eight-module custody suite returned
**233 passed**. Independent review found no blocker in this narrow scope. Complete-suite
and static/isolation gate results are recorded in the maintenance commit report.

This is **in-process on-disk source drift containment**, not proof of executed bytecode,
loaded modules, complete installed dependencies or trusted pre-execution admission.
Other wrappers/SDK artifacts (including indirect solders imports), standard library,
bytecode and the external trusted launcher/immutable image remain Batch 0 exits.
The changed manifest invalidates prior approvals; never silently rewrite certificates.
Fresh fetch still resolves `origin/main` to `a28c958`, lacking the custody prerequisite
and diverging from local `main`. A narrow local commit cannot authorize publishing that
larger feature or reconciling unrelated remote documentation. No push or remote CI claim
is made. Production and real funds remain blocked; no live-chain operation was used.

### Maintenance increment — eager indirect solders source drift (2026-10-05)

**Implemented locally; Batch 0 and publication remain blocked.** The first unresolved
priority is executable-artifact identity. This increment preserves the previous repairs
and adds the eighteen mandatory top-level Python wrappers eagerly imported by the pinned
`solders==0.26.0` initializer. The source manifest now binds the initializer plus all
25 mandatory flat wrappers, including `account`, `system_program`, `sysvar` and
`transaction_status`, even when service/dashboard import sets differ. Existing
non-executing source discovery, exact loader/origin validation, bounded nonblocking
reads and complete discovery/metadata rechecks apply without changing admission ordering.

All eighteen new drift regressions first reproduced unchanged build identity; the
expanded manifest now changes the digest without executing inspected source. An independent
expected inventory and AST inspection of the installed initializer check the scope.
Expanded invalid-file, loader, race and offline witness tests cover the added wrappers:
rejection preserves the ready permit, full custody bytes and absence of receipts/sidecars;
restoring the exact artifact permits claim, healthy completion and next-generation seal.
The focused eight-module gate returned **445 passed**. Independent review found no
blocking defect in this narrow scope. The clean Python 3.12 complete suite returned
**1330 passed, 77 subtests passed** in 101.37 seconds, with no skips. All three
CI-isolation shards passed (**35/36/85 tests**, with **52 subtests** in each recovery
shard). Dependency consistency, compilation, Markdown links, intended-index literal
inventory (**274 active lines**) and candidate whitespace checks passed.

This is **in-process on-disk drift containment**, not proof of executed bytecode or
trusted pre-execution attestation. Nested `solders.token`/`solders.rpc` packages,
optional `litesvm`/`transaction_metadata`, other installed artifacts, standard library,
bytecode and the external trusted launcher/immutable image remain Batch 0 exits.
The changed manifest invalidates prior approvals; never silently rewrite certificates.
Fresh fetch resolves `origin/main` to `a28c958`, still lacking the local custody
prerequisite and diverging from local `main`. Publishing this increment would implicitly
publish that larger feature and reconcile unrelated documentation, outside this repair.
No push or remote CI claim is made. Production and real funds remain blocked;
all chain boundaries were offline.

### Maintenance increment — eager solders token-initializer drift (2026-10-06)

**Implemented locally; Batch 0 and publication remain blocked.** The first unresolved
priority remains executable-artifact identity. Existing repairs bind the solders root
initializer and mandatory flat wrappers but omit the mandatory `solders.token` package
initializer that the pinned root initializer eagerly imports. This narrow increment
adds `token/__init__.py` to the deterministic on-disk source manifest. Non-executing
`PathFinder` discovery requires the conventional source initializer, exact source-loader
origin/path agreement and exactly its own package search directory. Existing bounded
nonblocking reads and whole-manifest discovery/metadata rechecks apply to the new file.

A collected regression first reproduced an unchanged build digest after inserting a
side effect into the token initializer. It now requires changed identity without
executing inspected source. Expanded tests cover missing/empty/non-file/unreadable
sources, invalid loaders/origins/package paths, flat-module substitution, mutation,
replacement, truncation, growth and discovery changes during reads, plus stat/open
races. Offline witness fixtures preserve the ready permit, full custody bytes and
receipt/sidecar absence on rejection, then claim, complete, report healthy and seal
with the exact restored artifact. The focused eight-module custody gate returned
**459 passed**, including equal fresh service/dashboard build identities. Full-suite,
static and CI-isolation gate results are recorded in the maintenance commit report.

This remains **in-process on-disk drift containment**, not executed-bytecode identity,
complete dependency verification or independently trusted pre-execution attestation.
Other nested token/RPC modules, optional SDK artifacts, other dependencies, standard
library/bytecode and the external trusted launcher/immutable image remain Batch 0 exits.
The changed manifest invalidates prior approvals; never silently rewrite certificates.
Fresh fetch still resolves `origin/main` to `a28c958`, lacking the local custody
prerequisite and diverging from local `main`. Publishing this increment would implicitly
publish that larger feature and require unrelated documentation reconciliation, outside
this repair. No push or remote CI claim is made. Production and real funds remain blocked;
all exercised chain boundaries were offline.

### Review correction — cold-parent token namespace discovery

The full suite at local `afba882` passed **1359 tests and 77 subtests**, but a fresh
standalone run of the source/native SDK modules exposed **five failures**. When the
selected token initializer is missing, a directory or a FIFO, `PathFinder` can try
to construct a namespace path and raise `KeyError('solders')` if the parent package
has not been imported. This still refuses admission, but escapes the documented
sanitized `AdmissionError` boundary; broader collection masked the import dependency.

The local correction converts that nested-discovery `KeyError` into invalid evidence
through the existing sanitized refusal path. It does not import the inspected parent,
relax loader/path checks or change permit ordering. Three explicit cold-parent tests
failed before the correction and now verify refusal without parent execution/import.
Existing standalone witness cases also verify unchanged permit/custody evidence.
The source/native SDK shard now passes **354 tests**; the clean Python 3.12 full suite
passes **1362 tests and 77 subtests**, with no skips. This is a local follow-up only;
publication and production remain blocked by the same prerequisite/divergence and
trusted-attestation requirements above.

### Maintenance increment — eager solders RPC-initializer drift (2026-10-06)

**Implemented locally; Batch 0 and publication remain blocked.** The first unresolved
priority remains executable-artifact identity. Previous fingerprint repairs are preserved.
The pinned solders root initializer eagerly attempts to import `solders.rpc`, but the
selected source manifest omitted its package initializer. This increment binds
`rpc/__init__.py` with the existing non-executing source-loader, exact origin/package-path,
bounded nonblocking read and whole-manifest discovery/metadata checks. The pinned wheel
ships this initializer as an empty file: only this exact manifest-relative source may
be empty, and its empty-byte digest is included. Missing evidence is still rejected.

The collected regression first reproduced unchanged build identity after adding a
side effect to the empty initializer; it now changes the fingerprint without executing
that source. Expanded regressions cover invalid files/loaders/package paths, cold-parent
namespace and flat-module substitutions, empty-file growth/replacement and read/open
races. Offline witness cases preserve the ready permit, custody bytes and absence of
receipts/sidecars on rejection, then claim, complete, report healthy and seal the exact
restored build. The eight-module focused gate passed **508 tests**. The clean Python 3.12
complete suite passed **1393 tests and 77 subtests** in 102.08 seconds, with no skips.
Independent read-only review found no blocking defect in this narrow scope. Final
static and CI-isolation gate results are recorded in the maintenance commit report.

This is **in-process on-disk drift containment**, not complete dependency or executed-
bytecode verification or independently trusted pre-execution admission. Nested token/RPC
wrappers, optional SDK artifacts, other dependencies, standard library/bytecode and the
external trusted launcher/immutable image remain Batch 0 exits. The changed manifest
invalidates previous approvals; never silently rewrite certificates. Fresh fetch resolves
`origin/main` to `a28c958800f64e802b3dfc367ac49ecf7a18e5fb`, which lacks the custody
prerequisite and diverges from local `main`. Publishing this increment would implicitly
publish that larger feature and reconcile unrelated documentation, outside this repair.
No push or remote CI claim is made. Production and real funds remain blocked;
all exercised chain boundaries were offline.

### Maintenance increment — eagerly attempted LiteSVM/metadata source drift (2026-10-06)

**Implemented locally; Batch 0 and publication remain blocked.** The first unresolved
priority remains executable-artifact identity. The pinned solders initializer eagerly
attempts to import `litesvm` and `transaction_metadata` under suppressed `ImportError`.
That suppression does not prevent present wrappers executing; both installed files
were outside the source manifest. This narrow increment binds `litesvm.py` and
`transaction_metadata.py` through the existing deterministic, non-executing discovery,
exact source-loader/origin validation, bounded nonblocking reads and whole-manifest
metadata/discovery rechecks. Both files are required and nonempty in this pinned-wheel
manifest, even though the SDK treats their imports as optional.

Two collected drift regressions first reproduced unchanged build identity after adding
side effects to these wrappers. They now require changed identity without executing
inspected source. Expanded existing cases cover missing/empty/non-file/unreadable
artifacts, invalid discovery/loaders, read/open races and source changes. Offline witness
cases preserve the ready permit, custody bytes and receipt/sidecar absence on rejection,
then admit, complete, report healthy and seal the exact restored artifact. The focused
eight-module custody gate returned **558 passed**. Independent read-only review found
no blocking defect. The clean Python 3.12 complete suite returned **1443 passed,
77 subtests passed** in 105.92 seconds, with no skips. Final static and CI-isolation
checks are recorded in the maintenance commit report.

This is **in-process on-disk drift containment**, not complete dependency, executed-
bytecode, loaded-memory or independently trusted pre-execution attestation. Nested SDK
modules, other dependencies, standard library/bytecode and the external trusted
launcher/immutable image remain Batch 0 exits. The changed manifest invalidates earlier
approvals; never silently rewrite certificates. Fresh fetch still resolves `origin/main`
to `a28c958800f64e802b3dfc367ac49ecf7a18e5fb`, lacking the custody prerequisite; the
branches diverge by two remote-only and ten local-only commits before this increment.
Publishing would implicitly publish that larger feature and require unrelated remote
documentation reconciliation, outside this repair. No push or remote CI claim is made.
Production and real funds remain blocked; all exercised chain boundaries were offline.

### Maintenance increment — installed RPC wire-source drift (2026-10-07)

**Implemented; Batch 0 and production remain blocked.** The first unresolved priority
is complete executable-artifact identity. Existing fingerprint repairs are preserved.
The pinned Solana RPC client imports `solders.rpc.requests` and `solders.rpc.responses`;
the latter eagerly imports `solders.rpc.errors`. These three installed Python wrappers
were omitted from the selected source fingerprint. This increment binds `rpc/requests.py`,
`rpc/responses.py` and `rpc/errors.py` through non-executing discovery within the already
validated RPC package directory. Exact conventional source-loader/origin agreement and
flat-module shape are required. Existing bounded nonblocking reads and whole-manifest
metadata/discovery rechecks apply; invalid evidence refuses before permit consumption.

All three collected byte-drift regressions first reproduced unchanged build identity.
They now require changed identity without executing inspected sources. An independent
AST inventory checks the installed client imports and the response-to-error dependency.
Expanded tests cover missing/empty/non-file/unreadable files, invalid loaders/origins,
namespace/package substitution with cold parents, read/open/discovery races, unchanged
witness permits and custody bytes on rejection, and exact claim/completion/sealing.
The eight-module focused gate returned **637 passed**; the standalone source/native SDK
shard returned **514 passed**. Independent read-only review found no blocking defect.
The clean Python 3.12 full suite returned **1522 passed, 77 subtests passed** in 106.01s,
with no skips. CI-isolation shards returned **35 passed/52 subtests**, **36 passed/52
subtests** and **85 passed**. Final static/index and publication results accompany the
maintenance commit report.

**Work-item grounding:** O4 attributable settlement/bounded risk and O1 inspectable
artifact evidence; settlement remains an explicit non-Atlas customer hypothesis.
Component owner is swapService startup/witness; the scheduled maintainer acts under the
operator's one-issue maintenance authorization. Production paths are
`src/custody_admission.py`, pinned `solana==0.36.9` and `solders==0.26.0`; collected tests
are `tests/test_custody_solders_sources.py` and `tests/test_custody_solders_artifact.py`.
No financial authority, dependency upgrade or live-chain operation is added.

Publication base is `8f710dd3a4c7227e668bc0f72c32c038483cd92a`, matching freshly fetched
`origin/main`; the previous prerequisite/divergence blocker is resolved for this repair.

```

This remains **in-process on-disk drift containment**, not executed-bytecode, mapped-
memory, complete dependency or trusted pre-execution attestation. Other nested SDK
modules, Solana/HTTP dependencies, standard library/bytecode and an external trusted
launcher/immutable image remain Batch 0 exits. The changed manifest invalidates prior
approvals; never silently rewrite certificates. All real-fund and release gates remain.

### Current acceptance register

| Area | Status | Next executable exit |
|---|---|---|
| Four retained-source conflict containments | **Accepted narrowly offline** | Preserve in every later batch; zero transport/full liability regressions remain collected |
| Sealed image/witness continuity | **Implemented, partial** | Externally attest every executed byte and dependency artifact; rehearse independent deployment and restore |
| Dashboard startup truth/read-only snapshot | **Accepted for current offline scope** | Keep missing-path/no-write and witness-transition tests; target deployment still required |
| Heartbeat/service and chain admission | **Blocked** | Exact owner/address/schema/pair/terms plus Solana health/root freshness and Nexus sync/tip freshness before mutation |
| Capacity eligible progress | **Blocked** | Move malformed/conflicting rows outside automatic FIFO without authorizing them |
| Hold resolution/live acceptance | **Blocked** | Evidence-bound operator workflow and explicit devnet/testnet matrix |

The sections below retain prior implementation detail and dated evidence. Their September 30 status labels
are historical where they conflict with this register; they do not supersede the October 2 verdict.

## Previous verdict — 2026-09-30

**Release blocked.** Reviewed range:

```text
base:        ed73c513ee22f9626502273aa0d8e42a4c238b7a
source:      1b267f2b708e484ec27ce53d0c85db4592d148c2
source tree: 7eaad283abb2255b312f6e6c1dabbc9582056d03
```

Two commits since the review base add conservative startup containment. `17a9f17` holds every retained
ordinary refund/quarantine state before its worker can derive a first disposition from current terms.
`1b267f2` holds a ready row when any debit transaction ID, reference or frozen output remains, even if
its input policy is valid. The first reproduced current-term Solana sends; the second reproduced a second
mocked Nexus debit that overwrote retained debit identity. Real startup and actual-worker regressions now
require zero transport, full liability and preserved evidence for both classes. Keep both controls.

They do **not** establish coherent restore admission. Status-specific containment is not a complete
deployment/restore identity or all-status evidence audit. General startup refusal can still look healthy
on the dashboard, malformed capacity evidence can still starve valid work, and dashboard summary can
create a missing database. See the [September 30 review](DEVELOPMENT_REVIEW_2026-09-30.md) and the
[current repair plan](plans/2026-09-25-recovery-admission-and-capacity-fairness.md).

## Implemented containment — empty-database startup visibility

**Implemented, reporting-only containment; R-1 remains open.** The read-only dashboard
now exposes the durable empty-database admission latch in `/api/summary`, `/api/issues`
and a prominent recovery banner. It reports total liabilities and open obligations as
unknown rather than treating absent local rows as zero. While admission is held or its
evidence is unreadable/malformed, backing ratio, fee totals and rolling payout usage are
unavailable; a retained metrics snapshot cannot make the page look recovered. Local row
counts remain explicitly local, and the backing-deficit banner cannot incorrectly claim
refunds/quarantine continue during recovery refusal.

The reader does not clear holds or write recovery state. Missing admission tables produce
an explicit unknown status, not a healthy result; raw database errors are not published by
the admission reader. An empty latch table means only `not_held`, with no claim of complete
liabilities or successful recovery. Operators must restore and independently verify coherent
custody evidence, never seed rows, clear holds or send funds manually to bypass admission.
Collected tests in `tests/test_dashboard_recovery_admission.py` cover the real startup latch,
retained healthy metrics, repeated reads/reinitialization, missing/malformed evidence, sanitized
read failure, and execution of the shipped JavaScript renderer (Node.js required for that shard).
Browser verification also exposed a pre-existing chained `Element.append()` call that broke
nonempty issue tables; the renderer now appends the header separately so recovery issues display.

This does not reconstruct principal, quantify lost liabilities, validate partial/stale restores,
or implement source-specific authorization/resolution. Those R-1/R-3 release gates remain open.

## R-1 maintenance containment — empty-database startup

**Implemented, narrow containment; R-1 is not closed.** Startup now records a durable
`recovery_admission_holds` latch when validated nonzero custody checkpoints meet a database
with no source lifecycle rows on either chain and no durable Solana deposit holds. It refuses
reconstruction before either chain scanner or reference seeding can make that database look
recovered. The normal `main.run()` gate reports `empty_custody_database_recovery_held` and
does not start pollers. Reinitialization, newer checkpoints and later source insertion do not
clear the latch; database read/write failures also refuse admission.

This intentionally blocks an empty new deployment too: there is no safe automatic bootstrap
exception and no latch-clearing command. Restore and independently verify a coherent custody
backup; do not seed dummy rows, alter checkpoints or delete the hold to force startup. Presence
of some retained rows is **not** proof of complete history or backup validity. Partial/stale
restores, databases already populated by an older unsafe replay, source-specific reconciliation,
quantified recovery visibility and an audited bootstrap/resolution protocol remain open under
R-1/R-3. No principal is reconstructed by this containment path, so an empty dashboard after
refusal must not be interpreted as zero liabilities or safe backing.

Collected coverage in `tests/test_empty_database_recovery.py` exercises the real startup caller
after DB/WAL loss of below-minimum, nonpositive-output, refund-cap and quarantine-cap holds;
durable refusal across restarts; persistence failures; and online-backup/DB+WAL restoration of
original disposition terms with exactly one mocked submission. Existing scanner tests retain
source history to exercise reconstruction past this new admission gate. All chain boundaries
are offline; this is not live-chain acceptance or independent release approval.

## Independent re-evaluation — 2026-09-28

The three newer repairs close the exact source-admission paths they claim:

1. unseen Solana inputs at or before the startup boundary become quantified historical-authorization
   holds through both core and Helius page committers;
2. retained ready rows with no policy become non-sendable before reconstruction; and
3. retained ready rows with partial, malformed, source-conflicting or nonpayable policy receive the same
   hold without rewriting their raw evidence, principal, reservations or capacity evidence.

The focused two-module shard returned **49 passed**. The three direct actual-worker families returned
**23 passed** across both providers, four lost-policy dispositions, three timestamp classes and twelve
invalid-policy forms. They exercised the real startup, deposit, refund and quarantine workers with only
external transport and provider boundaries replaced.

Fresh residual probes found that a retained row already labelled `to be refunded` or
`to be quarantined`, with both policy fields absent, is not audited because startup selects only
`ready for processing`. Recovery returned complete and each real disposition worker made one mocked
1,090-unit send from 1,100 units using the current 10-unit refund fee and current destination. This is
the same missing historical-authorization class in a different lifecycle state, not a failure of the
three narrower accepted controls.

The previously reported malformed-oldest capacity starvation, stale healthy dashboard after heartbeat
failure, and database creation by a missing-path summary read also reproduced unchanged. No live chain,
production credential or real send was used. See the [September 28 review](DEVELOPMENT_REVIEW_2026-09-28.md);
[September 25](DEVELOPMENT_REVIEW_2026-09-25.md) remains the pre-repair baseline.

## Independent re-evaluation — 2026-09-30

The published `17a9f17` ordinary-disposition fix closes the September 28 mocked-send reproductions:
startup changes retained ordinary refund, quarantine and legacy failed-quarantine rows to the existing
historical-authorization hold before either disposition worker can select them. Policy validity,
timestamp, worker limit and retained capacity/terminal siblings do not exempt an inconsistent source
status. Raw evidence, reservations and full principal remain unchanged.

Review then found a sibling lifecycle conflict at `17a9f17`: a retained ready row with valid payable
policy plus any previous debit-submission field remained selectable. In an isolated copy of that exact
source, the new regression module returned **41 failures**; the transaction-ID-only case called the mocked
Nexus debit a second time for 1,090 units and replaced its prior identity. `1b267f2` adds one atomic SQL
containment before policy validation: any non-NULL debit transaction ID, reference or frozen output holds
the row. Blank, zero, negative and malformed values also hold because none proves non-submission.

The two real-worker modules now return **159 passed**. They cover ordinary dispositions, valid/invalid
policy, every debit field alone and combined, absent/expired/active reservations, repeated startup, both
page committers, rollback, timestamps outside scan ranges, worker-limit progress and unchanged in-flight
states. This accepts both commits only as narrow containment. Coherent restore identity, complete per-state
evidence schemas, Nexus-side recovery and audited hold resolution remain open.

An isolated candidate containing the maintained architecture, plan and review update returned
**775 passed, 77 subtests passed**. Dependency consistency, byte compilation, local Markdown links,
the index-aware token-pair inventory (274 active lines), candidate/range whitespace and all three CI
isolation shards passed. Local execution does not establish target-chain semantics or release approval.

Fresh offline probes also reproduced malformed-oldest capacity starvation, stale healthy dashboard data
after heartbeat-missing startup refusal, and creation of a missing SQLite file by a dashboard summary read.
The current heartbeat validator still alerts and continues rather than forming a fail-closed chain/provider
identity gate. No live chain, production credential or real send was used.

## Architecture and verified progress

One process bridges one configured classic SPL token ↔ Nexus token pair. `config.SWAP_PAIR`
contains token/custody identity, independent decimals and fee terms. Gross conversion is 1:1 in
whole-token units before fees/rounding, not market pricing. Native SOL, Token-2022, arbitrary
chains and simultaneous pairs remain outside scope. Helius is a trusted primary provider; a
second attestor is not required. Exact amounts, success/finality and complete enumeration remain
application responsibilities.

| Area | Current implementation and acceptance boundary |
|---|---|
| A — disposition recovery, E-015/E-018 | Strict provenance parsing, conservative legacy-terminal migration, full-principal evidence holds, inferred-fee reversal and preserved proven cap spend. Atomic DDL/data rollback, in-place upgrade, online-backup and copied DB+WAL tests pass. This does not reconstruct an unsent B/C authorization that was lost with SQLite. |
| B — Solana input policy | Shared strict-integer minimum/maximum/decimal/fee classifier runs before destination routing. Below-minimum/nonpositive-output holds retain principal without fees. Frozen decisions survive restart **when the database survives**. |
| C — typed capacity holds | Durable typed outcomes, exact capacity diagnostics, liability/alert visibility, original-term retry and eligible FIFO are implemented for valid retained evidence. An individually impossible payout does not starve fitting work. A malformed oldest hold is fail-closed but can globally block a later valid fitting hold; see R-1b. Frozen retry requires retained intent evidence. |
| Ingestion/finality | Positive principal is durably retained; query/provider continuation is bound; unsupported/finality evidence is held; liability totals use one SQLite snapshot. Public waterlines pin behind unresolved sources. Source rediscovery alone does not reconstruct historical authorization. |
| Nexus identity/reconciliation, E-001–E-004/E-014 | Composite `(txid, contract_id)` identity, exact payout evidence, integer math and fail-closed backing controls remain. Automatic Nexus compensating transfers remain disabled; a narrow explicit operator protocol exists. |
| Optional receipts, E-016 | Durable outbox and independent positive-evidence/budget controls remain; production enablement is separately blocked pending cost/schema/target-chain acceptance. |
| Provider-v2 | Builder/validator and tests are committed, but registration, heartbeat, recovery and inspection still use v1. This is library-only implementation, not a default-v2 runtime migration. |

See [state machines](STATE_MACHINES.md) and the published
[historical A/B/C acceptance record](RECOVERY_INPUT_CAP_ACCEPTANCE.md). That tracked record documents
the original tested scope; the total-loss and scheduler qualifications in this evaluation are newer.

## September 30 findings retained for traceability

The October 2 acceptance register supersedes statuses in this section. R-1c and R-1d are implemented in
the staged offline witness/dashboard candidate but remain integration-gated by artifact and witness
operations. R-2 is no longer alert-and-continue, yet exact heartbeat identity and node freshness remain
blocked. R-1b, R-3 and live/provider gates remain open.

### R-1 — Historical partial/stale restore analysis

The empty-database latch and three new Solana controls are useful containment, not a coherent-restore
protocol. Table non-emptiness still permits startup without proving that policy, capacity, fee, cap and
terminal evidence belong to one complete generation. The previous source-only-ready replay to a current-
term Nexus debit is now blocked by `record_solana_recovery_boundary()` and the page-commit boundary.

The reviewed residual path was a retained **non-ready** source. That startup audited only
`status = 'ready for processing'`. A partial restore can retain `to be refunded` or
`to be quarantined` while losing both policy fields and any frozen capacity intent. Fresh offline probes
at the reviewed source made recovery report complete and then exercised each real disposition worker.
Each called the mocked Solana send boundary for 1,090 units from a 1,100-unit source using the current
10-unit fee and current resolved destination. The full principal remained a local liability pending
confirmation, so this proves replacement of historical authorization and one externally attempted send,
not realized loss or duplicate settlement.

Relevant code at the reviewed source was `state_db.py:1805-1853`, auditing only ready rows, and
`solana_client.py:1267-1602`, where new non-capacity disposition work derives fee and destination from
current configuration when no frozen capacity intent exists.

**Containment:** keep the empty-DB latch and all three new holds. Do not treat any nonempty/partial database
as verified; resume an existing deployment only from independently validated coherent DB+WAL/online-
backup evidence, otherwise remain paused. Do not manually run refund or quarantine workers over restored
rows whose frozen policy/capacity intent is absent or inconsistent.

**Implemented maintenance containment — unseen pre-startup Solana inputs:** startup now persists
an additive, monotonic `solana_recovery_boundary` before chain reconstruction. Both deposit page
committers retain a previously unseen source at or before that boundary as
`historical_solana_authorization_missing` rather than `ready for processing`. The full observed
principal, source and custody/query provenance remain in `solana_deposit_holds`; liabilities and
checkpoint pinning include those rows. Historical holds cannot be automatically promoted, including
through repeated pages or direct hold replay, and are excluded before the automatic replay limit.
The dashboard issues endpoint exposes them with exact integer principal and a no-manual-send warning.
Retained lifecycle/finality/parser rows are not reclassified by this unseen-source containment; the
additional source-only ready-row containment below applies at startup.

This is **not R-1 closure**: the boundary is the greater of the startup local timestamp, Solana
checkpoint and previously retained boundary, not an independent restore manifest or authoritative
chain-clock certificate. Inputs received while offline can conservatively require permanent holds
until an audited resolution protocol exists. Pre-fix replay rows, partial restores containing an
incomplete lifecycle component, unseen sources outside enumeration, Nexus-side reconstruction and
clock/identity assurance remain open. Do not infer complete liabilities from startup success or use
post-boundary timestamps as proof of a coherent restore. Empty-database startup still refuses replay.

Collected coverage in `tests/test_partial_restore_deposit_recovery.py` exercises stale backups retaining
one unrelated processed source after lost below-minimum/nonpositive/refund/quarantine decisions, both
page committers, changed terms, multiple pages, cutoff equality, restart/duplicate replay, full liability,
zero mocked sends, retained hold eligibility, query rollback, upgrade and persistence failures.

**Implemented maintenance containment — retained source-only ready rows:** in the same startup
transaction as the replay boundary, every retained `ready for processing` Solana row with both
`policy_decision` and `policy_evidence` absent becomes `historical_solana_authorization_missing`.
No timestamp or worker-limit exemption applies. Source fields, full principal, submission metadata,
reservations and capacity evidence are not rewritten or released. Existing liability/checkpoint logic
continues to include these non-sendable rows; the dashboard exposes their hold without suggesting
that retained capacity evidence authorizes retry. Reinitialization and duplicate pages cannot promote them.

The regression first reproduced a current-term Nexus debit from a retained source-only row. Collected
coverage in `tests/test_retained_source_recovery.py` now verifies zero transport for that case, sources
older than scan ranges and newer than the local clock, repeated startup, both page committers, more
held rows than the worker limit, preserved capacity evidence, and atomic rollback/refusal on a failed
hold write. Positive controls retain the original frozen policy through terms drift and admit genuinely
new post-startup sources. Existing online-backup/DB+WAL capacity-intent tests remain applicable.

**Implemented maintenance containment — invalid retained ready-row policy:** startup now validates
every retained ready row's frozen policy with the strict policy parser and exact source comparison.
Partial fields, malformed evidence, mismatched source/decision, and an internally valid nonpayable
decision on a ready row become the same non-sendable historical-authorization hold. No current
configuration repairs the stored evidence. The boundary and all status changes commit atomically;
raw evidence, principal, reservations, submission metadata and capacity evidence remain untouched.
These holds are visible in the existing dashboard issue queue and cannot monopolize the ready-worker
limit. Valid matching payable policy continues under its original terms after configuration drift.

Collected regressions in `tests/test_retained_source_recovery.py` cover partial fields, corrupt JSON,
all frozen source fields, decision/output conflicts and nonpayable-ready state, repeated startup and
both replay providers, zero transport/fees for affected sources, full liability, capacity/reservation
preservation, failed-write rollback and younger valid work behind more held rows than the worker limit.

This remains **narrow R-1 containment**, not closure. A crash after source admission but before the
first policy freeze now conservatively requires an audited resolution that does not yet exist.
Pre-fix rows already classified under replacement terms, apparently valid policy alongside missing
lifecycle components, remaining non-ready states and Nexus-side recovery still require the broader admission protocol.
Do not clear or manually retry these holds; production remains blocked.

**Implemented maintenance containment — retained ordinary dispositions:** the same startup transaction
now moves every retained `to be refunded`, `to be quarantined` and `quarantine failed` source to
`historical_solana_authorization_missing`, independent of timestamp, worker limit or policy validity.
Those worker paths create a first disposition using current fee/destination terms; even a valid input
policy does not authorize that replacement. A retained capacity/terminal sibling cannot exempt an
inconsistent ordinary source status. No policy, principal, reservation, submission metadata or capacity
evidence is overwritten. Existing dashboard warnings, liability accounting and checkpoint pinning apply.

Collected real-startup/worker regressions in `tests/test_retained_source_recovery.py` first reproduced
the unauthorized mocked sends. They cover all three ordinary states, missing/partial/corrupt/conflicting
and valid input policies, terms drift (including a fee consuming all principal), restart, both replay
providers, rollback/refusal on persistence failure, retained reservations/capacity evidence, and more
held rows than the worker limit ahead of a younger valid original-term capacity retry. Existing online-
backup and DB+WAL restore tests still verify exact frozen capacity-intent sends.

This is deliberately conservative: legitimate work interrupted before disposition freeze is also held,
with no manual bypass or audited release command. Frozen-capacity and in-flight/finality protocols are
unchanged, not newly certified. Valid ready policies can still coexist with missing lifecycle components;
all-status restore identity/completeness, Nexus-side recovery and operator resolution remain open.
**R-1 and production release remain blocked.**

**Implemented maintenance containment — ready rows with retained debit metadata (2026-09-30):**
startup now also holds every retained ready row with a non-NULL `txid`, `reference` or
`amount_usdd_units`, including blank, zero and malformed values. Valid payable input policy is not
proof that an earlier debit was never submitted. A partial restore retaining only a prior transaction
ID alongside a ready status previously reached a second mocked Nexus debit and overwrote that ID.
The new status-only update commits atomically with the replay boundary and existing startup audits;
raw policy/submission evidence, full principal and active/expired reservations remain unchanged.
No current terms repair the row and no manual retry or hold-clear command is introduced.

`tests/test_retained_ready_submission_recovery.py` covers isolated/combined metadata, absent/expired/
active reservations, both replay providers, repeated startup, dashboard visibility, rollback/refusal,
source timestamps outside scan ranges and beyond the local clock, and more held rows than the worker
limit ahead of one valid original-term debit. Existing in-flight states are explicitly unchanged.
This closes only an inconsistent-ready-state path: valid ready rows with other missing/conflicting
lifecycle components, capacity/finality states, Nexus-side restore admission and coherent-restore
identity remain unaudited by this slice. **R-1 and production release remain blocked.**

**Exit:** bind admission to a complete restore/deployment identity, or audit every retained and
rediscovered nonterminal lifecycle state before any worker can select it. A row without exact historical
policy, disposition and submission evidence must become a quantified, visible, non-sendable recovery
hold; current configuration cannot fill missing fields. Test stale/partial/pre-fix restores containing only
one lifecycle component, every ready/refund/quarantine/in-flight/capacity status, both disposition workers,
terms drift, multi-page replay and worker limits. Require zero transport, full liability and no inferred fee
absent exact historical authorization.

### R-1b — High operability: malformed oldest capacity evidence blocks later valid retries

The retry protocol correctly refuses malformed frozen evidence and retains all principal. However,
its global FIFO query still treats that unresolved row as the oldest eligible hold. A fresh real-worker
probe created two ordinary refund capacity holds, corrupted only the older hold's frozen JSON, released
the blocking budget, and ran the worker twice. Both runs returned zero; the valid younger 50-unit
refund remained `refund capacity held`, its attempt count increased from 1 to 3 with reason
`waiting behind older Solana payout capacity hold`, zero sends occurred, and the full 120-unit
liability remained. This is safe containment, but not progress or the claimed eligible-FIFO behavior.
The probe is session scratch only; its SHA-256 and exact output are recorded in the September 23 review.

Relevant code is `state_db.py:4158-4214,4770-4830` and
`solana_client.py:1289-1409`: loading the oldest hold returns `malformed_evidence`, while the later
valid prepare still selects that malformed source in the global oldest-hold query. The existing
suite covers malformed refusal, but not a younger fitting obligation behind it.

**Exit:** keep malformed/source-conflict/unknown-submission evidence non-sendable, but remove it from
automatic eligible FIFO after atomically promoting it to a distinct operator-action queue, or define
another durable scheduler disposition that cannot authorize transport. Add real refund and quarantine
worker tests with a malformed/conflicting oldest row, more rows than the worker limit, restart, alert
deduplication and later reviewed resolution. Require the younger valid original intent to submit
exactly once without deleting or reducing the blocked row's liability.

### R-1c — Superseded offline: current witness makes startup refusal externally durable

The current implementation replaces absence-of-latch readiness with external `ready/claimed/running/held`
evidence plus a local live-process receipt. Recovery, session and heartbeat failures occur before
`running`; failed/ambiguous claimed generations remain non-running or permanently held. The dashboard
suppresses retained healthy values unless the same exact running lease brackets its snapshot. Focused
runtime/dashboard tests cover failure boundaries and witness changes. Keep this integration-gated until
artifact identity and independent witness deployment are accepted.

### R-1d — Superseded offline: current dashboard is read-only and snapshot-consistent

The current dashboard uses one `mode=ro` SQLite transaction for summary counts, metrics and payout exposure,
then rechecks the witness lease. Missing-path tests prove no DB creation; concurrent-write tests prove one
snapshot. Preserve these tests against the final artifact and deployment.

### R-2 — Partially superseded: fatal validation remains identity/freshness-incomplete

Heartbeat false/exception now returns before lease completion and workers, and both chain genesis values
are pinned before database migration. However the heartbeat validator still accepts an object with a
mismatched address, owner, provider, pair and vault when its name resolves and three fields parse.
Genesis-only checks do not require Solana health/root freshness or Nexus sync/mode/network/tip freshness.
Session/heartbeat validation also follows database migration and recovery scans.

**Exit:** bind exact service-record address, owner, schema, pair/custody identity and terms, and require
authoritative chain health/sync/freshness before mutable startup. Test mismatch, unavailable evidence,
stale/unsynced nodes, wrong types and validator exceptions with zero database/scanner/poller/chain-write
calls; validate semantics on intended nodes.

### R-3 — High operability gate: non-capacity Solana holds lack audited resolution

Capacity-only holds can retry their retained original intent. Policy, recovery-evidence,
malformed-evidence, source/lifecycle-conflict and unknown-submission holds have no corresponding
audited Solana resolution command. Dashboard visibility is not a disposition protocol.
`nexus_transfer_operator.py` handles only an exact Nexus refund-hold family; actor strings do
not enforce distinct human approval roles.

**Do not follow** the direct-chain-transfer/manual-DB advice in `quarantine_viewer.py:409-418`.
It bypasses intent/cap/evidence protocols. The source text is flagged for repair, not changed in
this documentation-only review.

**Exit:** implement an evidence-bound operator protocol, or explicitly approve permanent retention
as policy. Require actor/rationale, competing-state checks, authoritative exact readback,
capacity accounting, atomic terminalization, replay/crash tests and no blind retries. If two-person
approval is required, enforce distinct identities rather than merely recording labels.

### R-4 — Publication gate: verify the documentation candidate and published SHA

[CI run 36316328344](https://github.com/distordialabs-brutus/swapService/actions/runs/36316328344)
completed successfully for exact source SHA `6769f7a1bb68dd2a975f4b39aa910f2405d38d42`.
Local exact-source dependency, compile, Markdown, inventory, full-suite, isolation and whitespace gates
also pass. This establishes the source baseline only; the documentation changes described here were not
part of that run.

**Exit:** stage only the explicitly reviewed documentation paths, run the index-aware inventory and
candidate whitespace/link/full-suite gates against that exact index, commit, push, read back the remote
branch SHA, and verify CI for that SHA. Preserve the unrelated dirty/untracked September 22 files and
untracked vision context; do not publish them implicitly.

### R-5 — Provider-v2 cutover remains a separate, blocked migration

`src/service_record.py` has no production importer. `ALLOW_LEGACY_PROVIDER_V1` is parsed but
inert; runtime v1 is not disabled by its false default. Immutable asset address, expected owner,
service ID and Nexus network settings do not currently protect registration/recovery callers.
The reviewer and parent measured the v2 fixture with `last_poll=0` at 1,448 bytes using the repository's
`service_record_size()` estimator, above its declared 1,024-byte budget. This is **not** proof of
the target node's exact encoded size limit; it blocks assuming the proposed record fits.

**Exit:** choose and verify a target-valid storage layout before any NXS-spending create, then
wire address-selected create/read/update, startup, heartbeat and recovery to one identity policy.
Enforce explicit legacy opt-in, exact owner/type/schema/service/pair/custody, monotonic terms,
secret-safe publication and agreement between published economics and executable policy. Test
multiple assets, name/address disagreement, readback delay, oversize rejection and migration on
the intended Nexus build. Provider-v2 is not a prerequisite to repairing R-1 in the existing
single-pair bridge; committing the library does not make it integrated.

## Fresh verification at the reviewed runtime — 2026-09-28

The exact tracked source ran in a detached disposable Git worktree, excluding every pre-existing dirty or
untracked documentation path. External boundaries were mocked or blocked; no real transaction was made.

| Executed gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Exact-source complete suite | **641 passed, 77 subtests passed in 81.69s** |
| New partial/retained-source modules | **49 passed in 6.47s** |
| Three direct actual-worker regression families | **23 passed in 3.68s** |
| Recovery standalone | **35 passed, 52 subtests passed in 2.59s** |
| Recovery plus installed SDK | **36 passed, 52 subtests passed in 2.97s** |
| Receipt/payout/Nexus-fee/SDK shard | **85 passed in 6.23s** |
| Dependency consistency, exact compilation and Markdown links | Passed |
| Token-literal inventory | Passed; **274 active lines** |
| Range and last-source-commit whitespace | Passed |
| Residual actual-worker probe | Refund and quarantine each reached one mocked 1,090-unit send without frozen policy |
| Three unchanged-risk probes | Reproduced capacity starvation, stale dashboard readiness and missing-path DB creation |

Remote `main` resolved to the reviewed source, and exact-source CI run 36316328344 is green. That CI does
not cover the documentation candidate. The untracked vision was read as context and not linked as a
published source; all pre-existing dirty/untracked paths retained their original hashes. Exact commands,
outputs and source hashes are retained in the complete local findings artifact for this review.

## Development and release sequence

1. **Close artifact identity first:** externally bind `swapService.py`, every runtime module, interpreter
   and installed dependency artifact before any repository code can execute or claim a witness permit.
2. Preserve all four published restored-source containments and the current exact-image/witness state
   machine; independently approve image financial coherence rather than equating a matching hash with it.
3. Bind the exact heartbeat owner/address/schema/pair/custody/terms and require Solana health/root freshness
   plus Nexus sync/mode/network/tip freshness before mutable startup.
4. Operationalize independently administered witness bootstrap/restore, then move invalid capacity evidence
   outside eligible FIFO without making it sendable and add evidence-bound Solana hold resolution.
5. Keep provider-v2 and receipts disabled/unclaimed as runtime capabilities until their separate
   migration/cost gates pass. Preserve compatibility; no dependency upgrade is part of this review.
6. On explicitly approved Solana devnet/Nexus test infrastructure, run both directions, mixed decimals,
   provider pagination/concurrent arrivals, finality, exact readback, Nexus references,
   accepted-but-unparsed/timeout outcomes, durable-boundary crashes, backup/WAL and total-loss recovery.
   Rehearse witness loss/ambiguity, alerts, holds, incident response, key rotation and TLS/session controls.
7. Re-review the final immutable artifact, run the complete configured gate, verify exact-head CI, then make
   a separate release decision. Production and real funds remain blocked; no live acceptance was performed.

The executable current plan is the
[September 25 recovery admission and capacity-fairness plan](plans/2026-09-25-recovery-admission-and-capacity-fairness.md).
The [October 2 review](DEVELOPMENT_REVIEW_2026-10-02.md) is the current dated evidence. The
[September 23 follow-up](plans/2026-09-23-financial-recovery-follow-up.md) and original
[A/B/C implementation plan](plans/recovery-input-cap-repairs.md) remain historical implementation records.
