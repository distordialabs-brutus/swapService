`809d45c` adds a durable empty-custody startup latch; `17f65a3` exposes that latch and
unreadable latch evidence on the dashboard. Both are verified containment and should be kept.
They close the exact empty-DB startup path, but do not prove partial/stale restores complete,
represent every startup failure on the dashboard, or repair malformed-oldest capacity FIFO.
See the [September 25 review](DEVELOPMENT_REVIEW_2026-09-25.md), the
[complete findings artifact](review_evidence/2026-09-25/findings.md), and the
[current repair plan](plans/2026-09-25-recovery-admission-and-capacity-fairness.md).

## Implemented containment — empty-database startup visibility

**Implemented, reporting-only containment; R-1 remains open.** The read-only dashboard
now exposes the durable empty-database admission latch in `/api/summary`, `/api/issues`
and a prominent recovery banner. It reports total liabilities and open obligations as
unknown rather than treating absent local rows as zero. While admission is held or its
evidence is unreadable/malformed, backing ratio, fee totals and rolling payout usage are
unavailable; a retained metrics snapshot cannot make the page look recovered. Local row
counts remain explicitly local, and the backing-deficit banner cannot incorrectly claim
refunds/quarantine continue during recovery refusal.

The reader does not clear holds or write recovery state. Missing admission tables produce
an explicit unknown status, not a healthy result; raw database errors are not published by
the admission reader. An empty latch table means only `not_held`, with no claim of complete
liabilities or successful recovery. Operators must restore and independently verify coherent
custody evidence, never seed rows, clear holds or send funds manually to bypass admission.
Collected tests in `tests/test_dashboard_recovery_admission.py` cover the real startup latch,
retained healthy metrics, repeated reads/reinitialization, missing/malformed evidence, sanitized
read failure, and execution of the shipped JavaScript renderer (Node.js required for that shard).
Browser verification also exposed a pre-existing chained `Element.append()` call that broke
nonempty issue tables; the renderer now appends the header separately so recovery issues display.

This does not reconstruct principal, quantify lost liabilities, validate partial/stale restores,
or implement source-specific authorization/resolution. Those R-1/R-3 release gates remain open.

## R-1 maintenance containment — empty-database startup

**Implemented, narrow containment; R-1 is not closed.** Startup now records a durable
`recovery_admission_holds` latch when validated nonzero custody checkpoints meet a database
with no source lifecycle rows on either chain and no durable Solana deposit holds. It refuses
reconstruction before either chain scanner or reference seeding can make that database look
recovered. The normal `main.run()` gate reports `empty_custody_database_recovery_held` and
does not start pollers. Reinitialization, newer checkpoints and later source insertion do not
clear the latch; database read/write failures also refuse admission.

This intentionally blocks an empty new deployment too: there is no safe automatic bootstrap
exception and no latch-clearing command. Restore and independently verify a coherent custody
backup; do not seed dummy rows, alter checkpoints or delete the hold to force startup. Presence
of some retained rows is **not** proof of complete history or backup validity. Partial/stale
restores, databases already populated by an older unsafe replay, source-specific reconciliation,
quantified recovery visibility and an audited bootstrap/resolution protocol remain open under
R-1/R-3. No principal is reconstructed by this containment path, so an empty dashboard after
refusal must not be interpreted as zero liabilities or safe backing.

Collected coverage in `tests/test_empty_database_recovery.py` exercises the real startup caller
after DB/WAL loss of below-minimum, nonpositive-output, refund-cap and quarantine-cap holds;
durable refusal across restarts; persistence failures; and online-backup/DB+WAL restoration of
original disposition terms with exactly one mocked submission. Existing scanner tests retain
source history to exercise reconstruction past this new admission gate. All chain boundaries
are offline; this is not live-chain acceptance or independent release approval.

## Independent re-evaluation — 2026-09-25

The empty-DB latch now prevents the previously reproduced total DB/WAL-loss startup path from
reaching reconstruction or pollers. The dashboard truthfully exposes that one latch. Fresh broader
probes still found three open boundaries:

1. one unrelated surviving source row bypasses the latch, after which replay can authorize a lost
   obligation under current terms;
2. heartbeat failure can make startup refuse while the dashboard reports `not_held`, a healthy retained
   ratio and zero recovery issues; and
3. an oldest malformed capacity hold still starves younger valid work while retaining all liability.

A separate probe found that `api_summary()` creates a SQLite file when the configured database path is
missing, because it mixes `_ro_conn()` with state helpers that use ordinary writable connections.
No live chain or production credential was used. The [September 25 review](DEVELOPMENT_REVIEW_2026-09-25.md)
contains exact commands/results; [September 23](DEVELOPMENT_REVIEW_2026-09-23.md) remains the historical
pre-containment assessment.

## Architecture and verified progress

One process bridges one configured classic SPL token ↔ Nexus token pair. `config.SWAP_PAIR`
contains token/custody identity, independent decimals and fee terms. Gross conversion is 1:1 in
whole-token units before fees/rounding, not market pricing. Native SOL, Token-2022, arbitrary
chains and simultaneous pairs remain outside scope. Helius is a trusted primary provider; a
second attestor is not required. Exact amounts, success/finality and complete enumeration remain
application responsibilities.

| Area | Current implementation and acceptance boundary |
|---|---|
| A — disposition recovery, E-015/E-018 | Strict provenance parsing, conservative legacy-terminal migration, full-principal evidence holds, inferred-fee reversal and preserved proven cap spend. Atomic DDL/data rollback, in-place upgrade, online-backup and copied DB+WAL tests pass. This does not reconstruct an unsent B/C authorization that was lost with SQLite. |
| B — Solana input policy | Shared strict-integer minimum/maximum/decimal/fee classifier runs before destination routing. Below-minimum/nonpositive-output holds retain principal without fees. Frozen decisions survive restart **when the database survives**. |
| C — typed capacity holds | Durable typed outcomes, exact capacity diagnostics, liability/alert visibility, original-term retry and eligible FIFO are implemented for valid retained evidence. An individually impossible payout does not starve fitting work. A malformed oldest hold is fail-closed but can globally block a later valid fitting hold; see R-1b. Frozen retry requires retained intent evidence. |
| Ingestion/finality | Positive principal is durably retained; query/provider continuation is bound; unsupported/finality evidence is held; liability totals use one SQLite snapshot. Public waterlines pin behind unresolved sources. Source rediscovery alone does not reconstruct historical authorization. |
| Nexus identity/reconciliation, E-001–E-004/E-014 | Composite `(txid, contract_id)` identity, exact payout evidence, integer math and fail-closed backing controls remain. Automatic Nexus compensating transfers remain disabled; a narrow explicit operator protocol exists. |
| Optional receipts, E-016 | Durable outbox and independent positive-evidence/budget controls remain; production enablement is separately blocked pending cost/schema/target-chain acceptance. |
| Provider-v2 | Builder/validator and tests are committed, but registration, heartbeat, recovery and inspection still use v1. This is library-only implementation, not a default-v2 runtime migration. |

See [state machines](STATE_MACHINES.md) and the published
[historical A/B/C acceptance record](RECOVERY_INPUT_CAP_ACCEPTANCE.md). That tracked record documents
the original tested scope; the total-loss and scheduler qualifications in this evaluation are newer.

## Remaining findings, in repair order

### R-1 — High: partial/stale restore can still lose and reinterpret unsent authorization

The new latch closes the exact **empty** database path: with positive waterlines and no retained source
history it persists refusal before reconstruction. Its exemption is only `any()` row across the source
lifecycle/deposit-hold tables. One unrelated retained row therefore lets startup proceed without proving
that every other policy decision, capacity hold, fee, cap event and terminal row came from one coherent
restore. Databases populated by the older unsafe replay also avoid the empty-state check.

A fresh real-caller probe started with a 1,100-unit source frozen as a 1,090-unit oversized refund under a
50-unit cap. It then modeled a partial restore that retained one unrelated processed source but lost that
obligation and its frozen evidence. Startup returned complete, wrote no admission latch, replay admitted
the lost source after the maximum changed, and the real deposit worker invoked the mocked Nexus debit
boundary for 1,100 units. This proves an offline authorization-contract mutation, not live loss.

Relevant code is `state_db.py:1739-1771`: table non-emptiness suppresses the latch. The subsequent replay
and worker paths remain `state_db.py:1793-1915` and `solana_client.py:1007-1169` at the reviewed source.

**Containment:** keep the empty-DB latch. Do not treat any nonempty/partial database as verified; resume an
existing deployment only from independently validated coherent DB+WAL/online-backup evidence, otherwise
remain paused.

**Implemented maintenance containment — unseen pre-startup Solana inputs:** startup now persists
an additive, monotonic `solana_recovery_boundary` before chain reconstruction. Both deposit page
committers retain a previously unseen source at or before that boundary as
`historical_solana_authorization_missing` rather than `ready for processing`. The full observed
principal, source and custody/query provenance remain in `solana_deposit_holds`; liabilities and
checkpoint pinning include those rows. Historical holds cannot be automatically promoted, including
through repeated pages or direct hold replay, and are excluded before the automatic replay limit.
The dashboard issues endpoint exposes them with exact integer principal and a no-manual-send warning.
Retained lifecycle/finality/parser rows are not reclassified by this containment.

This is **not R-1 closure**: the boundary is the greater of the startup local timestamp, Solana
checkpoint and previously retained boundary, not an independent restore manifest or authoritative
chain-clock certificate. Inputs received while offline can conservatively require permanent holds
until an audited resolution protocol exists. Pre-fix replay rows, partial restores containing an
incomplete lifecycle component, unseen sources outside enumeration, Nexus-side reconstruction and
clock/identity assurance remain open. Do not infer complete liabilities from startup success or use
post-boundary timestamps as proof of a coherent restore. Empty-database startup still refuses replay.

Collected coverage in `tests/test_partial_restore_deposit_recovery.py` exercises stale backups retaining
one unrelated processed source after lost below-minimum/nonpositive/refund/quarantine decisions, both
page committers, changed terms, multiple pages, cutoff equality, restart/duplicate replay, full liability,
zero mocked sends, retained hold eligibility, query rollback, upgrade and persistence failures.

**Exit:** bind admission to a complete restore/deployment identity, or retain each affected rediscovered
source as a quantified, visible, non-sendable recovery hold. Test stale/partial/pre-fix restores containing
only one lifecycle component, every policy/disposition kind, terms drift, multi-page replay and worker
limits. Require zero transport, full liability and no inferred fee absent exact historical authorization.

### R-1b — High operability: malformed oldest capacity evidence blocks later valid retries

The retry protocol correctly refuses malformed frozen evidence and retains all principal. However,
its global FIFO query still treats that unresolved row as the oldest eligible hold. A fresh real-worker
probe created two ordinary refund capacity holds, corrupted only the older hold's frozen JSON, released
the blocking budget, and ran the worker twice. Both runs returned zero; the valid younger 50-unit
refund remained `refund capacity held`, its attempt count increased from 1 to 3 with reason
`waiting behind older Solana payout capacity hold`, zero sends occurred, and the full 120-unit
liability remained. This is safe containment, but not progress or the claimed eligible-FIFO behavior.
The probe is session scratch only; its SHA-256 and exact output are recorded in the September 23 review.

Relevant code is `state_db.py:4158-4214,4770-4830` and
`solana_client.py:1289-1409`: loading the oldest hold returns `malformed_evidence`, while the later
valid prepare still selects that malformed source in the global oldest-hold query. The existing
suite covers malformed refusal, but not a younger fitting obligation behind it.

**Exit:** keep malformed/source-conflict/unknown-submission evidence non-sendable, but remove it from
automatic eligible FIFO after atomically promoting it to a distinct operator-action queue, or define
another durable scheduler disposition that cannot authorize transport. Add real refund and quarantine
worker tests with a malformed/conflicting oldest row, more rows than the worker limit, restart, alert
deduplication and later reviewed resolution. Require the younger valid original intent to submit
exactly once without deleting or reducing the blocked row's liability.

### R-1c — High operability: general startup refusal is not durable dashboard admission

The dashboard reads only `recovery_admission_holds`. An empty table becomes `not_held`, although startup
can fail before the latch (for example heartbeat missing/malformed) or during later reconstruction. A fresh
probe retained a healthy metrics snapshot, made heartbeat lookup return missing and observed startup
`recovery_complete=False`; the dashboard still returned ratio `20000`, `not_held` and zero issues.
`main.run()` remains fail-closed, so this is operator misinformation rather than a transport bypass.

**Exit:** persist one startup-owned `pending`/`held`/`complete` state with sanitized reason/timestamps.
Only a valid durable `complete` result may expose healthy metrics, and admission plus metrics/counts must be
read from one SQLite snapshot. Cover every startup failure and crash boundary, not only empty custody.

### R-1d — Medium hardening: the dashboard can create a missing database

`_recovery_admission_status()` uses `mode=ro`, but `api_summary()` then calls state helpers whose ordinary
`sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH)` creates the file when it is absent. The review reproduced this against a
temporary missing path. This does not clear a hold or authorize startup, but violates the read-only
boundary and can mutate filesystem state before service initialization.

**Exit:** use one read-only connection/transaction or dedicated read-only state API for each dashboard
response. Assert no DB/WAL/SHM creation or byte change for all endpoints and snapshot-consistent behavior
when admission changes concurrently.

### R-2 — High deployment-safety gap: invalid registration is alert-only

`src/main.py:370-379` reports failed heartbeat validation or an exception but does not return;
execution can continue to pollers. The independent reviewer exercised that path offline. The
current validator checks readability/fields/parseable waterlines, not complete owner/address/
pair/terms identity. Authoritative network and freshness admission is also missing: known Solana
hostname/label checks exist, but custom endpoints are not checked against genesis/health/root
freshness, and Nexus network/sync/tip freshness is not an enforced startup gate.

**Exit:** add explicit fail-closed registration and authoritative chain-identity/freshness admission
before mutable startup/polling. Test mismatch, unavailable evidence, stale/unsynced nodes and
validator exceptions with zero poller/chain-write calls; validate semantics on intended nodes.
Do not equate a configured network label or a successful recovery mock with this gate.

### R-3 — High operability gate: non-capacity Solana holds lack audited resolution

Capacity-only holds can retry their retained original intent. Policy, recovery-evidence,
malformed-evidence, source/lifecycle-conflict and unknown-submission holds have no corresponding
audited Solana resolution command. Dashboard visibility is not a disposition protocol.
`nexus_transfer_operator.py` handles only an exact Nexus refund-hold family; actor strings do
not enforce distinct human approval roles.

**Do not follow** the direct-chain-transfer/manual-DB advice in `quarantine_viewer.py:409-418`.
It bypasses intent/cap/evidence protocols. The source text is flagged for repair, not changed in
this documentation-only review.

**Exit:** implement an evidence-bound operator protocol, or explicitly approve permanent retention
as policy. Require actor/rationale, competing-state checks, authoritative exact readback,
capacity accounting, atomic terminalization, replay/crash tests and no blind retries. If two-person
approval is required, enforce distinct identities rather than merely recording labels.

### R-4 — Publication gate: verify the new exact head independently of source-SHA history

[CI run 35755684698](https://github.com/distordialabs-brutus/swapService/actions/runs/35755684698)
for source SHA `85030c890fa6f3bb7db97e068e5cf80827d21b28` passed dependency, compile, Markdown,
full-suite and isolation steps, then
failed `git diff --check HEAD~1 HEAD`. Local reproduction reports 194 whitespace findings in
`docs/review_evidence/2026-09-15/committed-since-sept12.diff` and 2 in `dirty-config.diff`.
This is a historical result for that source SHA and a committed-artifact failure, not a failed
runtime test. It does not predict the result for a later documentation commit whose `HEAD~1..HEAD`
delta does not rewrite those raw forensic `.diff` bytes.

**Exit:** after the five review documents are staged, run the index-aware inventory and candidate
whitespace/link gates, then verify CI for the resulting exact publication SHA. Do not rewrite raw
forensic `.diff` bytes merely to repair the earlier source-SHA run; any future archival normalization
must be separately scoped and preserve provenance. The artifacts were not rewritten here.

### R-5 — Provider-v2 cutover remains a separate, blocked migration

`src/service_record.py` has no production importer. `ALLOW_LEGACY_PROVIDER_V1` is parsed but
inert; runtime v1 is not disabled by its false default. Immutable asset address, expected owner,
service ID and Nexus network settings do not currently protect registration/recovery callers.
The reviewer and parent measured the v2 fixture with `last_poll=0` at 1,448 bytes using the repository's
`service_record_size()` estimator, above its declared 1,024-byte budget. This is **not** proof of
the target node's exact encoded size limit; it blocks assuming the proposed record fits.

**Exit:** choose and verify a target-valid storage layout before any NXS-spending create, then
wire address-selected create/read/update, startup, heartbeat and recovery to one identity policy.
Enforce explicit legacy opt-in, exact owner/type/schema/service/pair/custody, monotonic terms,
secret-safe publication and agreement between published economics and executable policy. Test
multiple assets, name/address disagreement, readback delay, oversize rejection and migration on
the intended Nexus build. Provider-v2 is not a prerequisite to repairing R-1 in the existing
single-pair bridge; committing the library does not make it integrated.

## Fresh verification at the reviewed runtime — 2026-09-25

The exact tracked source ran in a detached disposable Git worktree, excluding every pre-existing dirty or
untracked documentation path. The source/tree/index identities are recorded above and in the findings
artifact.

| Executed offline gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Exact-source complete suite | **592 passed, 77 subtests passed in 74.88s** |
| New latch/dashboard/capacity modules | **58 passed in 7.62s** |
| Recovery/policy/cap/latch/dashboard focused set | **191 passed, 52 subtests passed in 17.95s** |
| Recovery standalone | **35 passed, 52 subtests passed** |
| Recovery plus installed SDK | **36 passed, 52 subtests passed** |
| Receipt/payout/Nexus-fee/SDK shard | **85 passed** |
| Dependency consistency, compilation, exact-source Markdown links | Passed |
| Token-literal inventory | Passed; **274 active lines** |
| Source commit and working documentation whitespace | Passed |
| Four offline review probes | Reproduced R-1, R-1b, R-1c and R-1d; network/send boundaries blocked |

The shared dirty-tree full suite reported **591 passed, 77 subtests passed, 1 failed** because pre-existing
untracked `vision.md` links to strategy files outside the repository and the link checker rejects paths that
escape the repository. That file was read as user context and left unchanged. The exact tracked-source gate
is green; neither scope is live-chain acceptance. Commands, raw results, source hashes and dirty-scope
separation are in the [September 25 findings](review_evidence/2026-09-25/findings.md).

## Development and release sequence

1. **Close R-1 first** with collected stale/partial/pre-fix restore tests. Keep the empty-DB latch and
   retained A/B/C controls; do not replace them with table non-emptiness or current-term replay.
2. Close R-1c so every startup refusal is durable and healthy dashboard values require a complete
   admission record from the same snapshot.
3. Repair R-1b without releasing malformed/conflicting evidence to transport: separate operator-action
   rows from validated eligible FIFO and prove later valid work progresses with liability conserved.
4. Close R-1d with genuinely read-only snapshot-consistent dashboard APIs, then close R-2 and R-3 through
   independent caller-level review.
5. Keep provider-v2 and receipts disabled/unclaimed as runtime capabilities until their separate
   migration/cost gates pass. Preserve compatibility; no dependency upgrade is part of this review.
6. On explicitly approved Solana devnet/Nexus test infrastructure, run both directions, mixed decimals,
   provider pagination/concurrent arrivals, finality, exact readback, Nexus references,
   accepted-but-unparsed/timeout outcomes, durable-boundary crashes, backup/WAL and total-loss recovery.
   Rehearse alerts, holds, incident response, key rotation and TLS/session controls.
7. Re-review the final runtime identity, run the complete configured gate, then make a separate release
   decision. Production and real funds remain blocked; no live acceptance was performed.

The executable current plan is the
[September 25 recovery admission and capacity-fairness plan](plans/2026-09-25-recovery-admission-and-capacity-fairness.md).
The [September 23 follow-up](plans/2026-09-23-financial-recovery-follow-up.md) and original
[A/B/C implementation plan](plans/recovery-input-cap-repairs.md) remain historical implementation records.
